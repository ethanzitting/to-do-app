Load Sequence
1. header, footer, and bare body load.
2. IndexedDB initializes, and project data is retrieved.
3. Projects are loaded to DOM.
4. Functionality of Add Project and Add Task buttons is built, finalizing load.

Interactivity:
1. When Add Project is clicked, create a project object and save it to IndexedDB.
2. When the projects information is changed, save that to IDB, 
	ideally automatically without a save button.
3. When the Add Task button is clicked, add a task to the project in IndexedDB.
4. When it's text or status is edited, save that to Indexed DB.



Using IndexedDB

A database must be initialized?


Then an object store must be created inside that database?
